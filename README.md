## About The Project

**Gambits.in** is the upcoming training ground for the boldest players on the board. 

While modern engines strive for "0.00" equality, we believe chess is a battle of psychology and will. This project serves as the pre-launch waitlist for a platform dedicated entirely to the art of the gambit—where material is temporary, but initiative is forever.

**Current Status:** Pre-launch (2026)

## Philosophy: The Art of Sacrifice

> "You must take your opponent into a deep dark forest where 2+2=5, and the path leading out is only wide enough for one." — **Mikhail Tal**

In an era dominated by engine preparation and dry positional play, we are bringing back the fire of the Romantic era. Gambits.in is not for those who seek safety. It is for the players who:

*   Prefer chaos over order.
*   Understand that a sacrifice is not just a calculation, but a declaration of intent.
*   Seek to create complications that engines despise but humans crumble under.

We are building the home for the "Magicians" of the next generation.

## Technology Stack

This repository contains the source code for the high-performance landing page, showcasing modern web development practices:

*   **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a minimalist, dark aesthetic.
*   **Visuals**: Custom HTML5 Canvas implementation for the "Neural Tactics" background.
*   **Performance**: Static export optimized for edge delivery on Vercel.
