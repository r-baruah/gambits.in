## ♟️ About The Project

Gambits.in is a high-performance, conversion-focused landing page for an upcoming chess education platform dedicated to the art of the sacrifice. This project serves as the initial pre-launch waitlist to gather interest for the "ultimate interactive library for chess gambits."

Built with a focus on **minimalism**, **performance**, and **aesthetic depth**, the site features a custom interactive background that simulates the neural pathways of tactical calculation.

### Key Features

*   **Interactive Visuals**: A custom-built, mouse-reactive "neural network" background simulating tactical calculations with fluid particle physics.
*   **Performance First**: Highly optimized static build with minimal bundle size using Next.js App Router.
*   **Conversion Optimization**: Integrated email capture form for waitlist management.
*   **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensuring perfect rendering across all devices.

## 🚀 Vision

The vision for **Gambits.in** is to evolve into the premier destination for aggressive chess players. Unlike traditional platforms that focus on solid, positional play, Gambits.in will be the home for the risk-takers.

> "To play a gambit is to say: I am willing to lose in order to win."

We aim to build a startup that offers:
1.  **Interactive Repertoire Training**: Learn complex gambit lines through spaced repetition.
2.  **Sacrifice Engine**: A specific tactical trainer focused purely on material sacrifices.
3.  **Community**: A network of players who prefer the sharpest lines in chess.

**Domain Ownership**: The domain `gambits.in` is owned by Ripuranjan Baruah. We are currently in the pre-seed / prototyping phase.
